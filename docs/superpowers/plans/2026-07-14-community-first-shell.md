# Community-First Shell — Implementation Plan

## Execution progress (2026-07-15)

| Unit | State | Commit | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 native rebuild | ✅ done | — | 5 staticlibs, `nm` confirms symbols |
| P2 in-flight app work | ✅ done | `cb90b14` | iOS 198 / Android 110 |
| P3 coverage baseline | ✅ done | `2040ccc`, `e43286c` | 94.60%→96.47%; 121 lines unreachable; **100% gate is unreachable — owner decision open** |
| dead-code cleanup | ✅ done | `0e5c34c` | phantom `closed` guard + orphaned oracle helpers deleted |
| **1A newswire projection** | ✅ done | `d150e79` | 746 Rust tests (isolated); bindings+staticlibs rebuilt; macOS RiotKit compiles. **This is the CurrentEntryV2 deviation — owner ratification open** |
| **0A canonical catalog** | ✅ done | `09413e6` | Rust 8/8; iOS StarterResourceTests 7/7; iOS app builds with all 8 pairs |
| **0C runtime containment (SECURITY)** | ✅ done | `d9699e8` | Rust 75 suites (apps_contract 44/44); iOS 209 (2 known-red); Android 113/0; JS egress 5/5+2/2. Gate reaches the page (end-to-end revocation test through the REAL bridge); §4.7 revoked→Return-to-Tools via is_valid(); CSP-stripped egress backstop, fail-closed. **⚠️ KNOWN RESIDUAL — see Risk 9.** |
| **0B Riverside authority** | ✅ done | `1276024` | 75 Rust suites; iOS RiversideMemberToolUITests SUCCEEDED; full iOS 205 (only 2 known-red). **Also fixed a real 1A bug:** the FFI list/inspect path never handled newswire entries (`is_newswire_prefix` missing from `inspectable_entries` + `list_current_entries`) — closed with a demo-independent regression test |
| **1B post an update** | ✅ done | `7758beb` | PostUpdateTests 12/12 (iOS + macOS); iOS app builds; no FFI change |
| **1C known contributors** | ✅ done | `774f629` | PeopleSurfaceTests 10/10 (incl. adversarial organizer-impostor); Rust contributors 6/6 + FFI 2/2. Clippy regression later cleared in `0ab1ccd` |
| **1E newswire merge & share** | ✅ done | `eb5392f` (Rust/FFI) + `9b9c90b` (native) | Rust import 13/13 + FFI share 4/4; iOS NewswireShareTests 4/4 (golden-digest byte-identity); Android 3/3; macOS builds. Cross-platform golden harness built. **⚠️ Android digest identity assumed — Risk 10.** |
| **2A adaptive shell (THE PAYOFF)** | ✅ done | `0a07d59` | iOS 254 tests / 252 pass (only 2 known-red); ShellNavigationTests 28/28; iOS Riot.app + macOS Riot-macOS both BUILD SUCCEEDED; no FFI change. Four routes (Home/Tools/People/Nearby); create-community signs `SpaceDescriptorV1` with founding roster. **⚠️ joined/loaded-community Home has no content yet — Risk 11 (Unit 3 closes).** |
| **2B nearby ownership & recovery (SECURITY)** | ✅ done + ratified | `e9a1b77` + `4cbebee` | Independent security-auditor verdict **HOLDS** — no pre-confirm community-metadata disclosure on either iOS transport or Android; **found + fixed a REAL leak** (auto-connect/accept + immediate `SpaceAnnounce`). Bilateral confirmation gate; import/switch race fails closed; coordinator survives routing. iOS 266/264 (2 known-red); TransportContractTests 43/43; both apps build. Hardened 2 phantom/untested gate gaps (raw-byte namespace opacity + anti-fingerprint call-site). No FFI. Known property: fixed BLE service UUID = passive app-presence beacon (not community metadata). |
| **2C editorial actions, front page & open wire** | ✅ done + ratified | `7ea4ad1` | iOS 285/283 (2 known-red); NewswireSurfaceTests 19/19; Android RiotControllerNewswireTest 13/13; both apps build. Non-editor action **IGNORED — effect absent** (proven through REAL core: roster-excludes-founder → hide rejected AND post treatment stays `.ordinary` on re-projection, not just a hidden control); closed field table all 6 kinds; 3 distinct empty states; cross-platform identity by reading core's `frontPage`/`openWire`/`editorialHistory` verbatim. `AlertDetailView` removed (Home-only). Android native-signing rejection assumed-not-proven (host-JVM, Risk 10 pattern). No FFI. |
| **3 multiple communities (registry; SECURITY)** | ✅ done + ratified | 3A `1e29f06`+`71804d3`, 3B `6fa0c10`+`80f3a5f`, 3C `2d4f2bc` | **The final unit.** SQLite community registry, per-community DISTINCT sealed identity (unlinkable; Case-1 durable on both platforms), isolated switch, fail-closed switch/write race via the (now genuinely wired) community-generation guard, quarantine on bad key / corrupt blob, archive/restore. **Security core TWICE independently audited: isolation HOLDS + phantom-guard fix COMPLETE-AND-COVERED.** iOS 297/295 (2 known-red), CommunityChooserTests 12/12 incl real `<300ms` hard-gate switch, ShellNav 28/28, both apps build; Android 136/0; Rust persistence_contract 13/13, clippy 0. **Risk 11 CLOSED** — newswire Home reprojects on reopen. **Owner-ratify: per-community sealed identity (Risk 12).** **Residual: unsealed-author RAM window between join and persist (Risk 13).** **Scoped out: multi-community JOIN affordance in the app UI** (create-N + switch works; joining a SECOND community while holding one is single-community-gated at the app wrapper — the FFI supports it; DoD #1 "follow multiple" — estimate pending for 3D-vs-residual). |

**PLAN COMPLETE (2026-07-15):** all units P1 → 3 landed and independently re-verified against a fresh native build. Combined final state: Rust workspace green (persistence_contract 13/13, clippy `-D warnings` 0, fmt clean); **iOS full RiotKit 297 tests / 295 pass — only the 2 pre-existing known-red `TwoPeerNearbySyncTests` Bonjour failures**; iOS Riot.app + macOS Riot-macOS both BUILD SUCCEEDED; Android `testDebugUnitTest` 136 / 0. Two security gates found + fixed REAL issues (2B nearby disclosure leak; 3A phantom generation-guard), each re-verified by an independent adversarial auditor. **Not done / owner decisions:** web/gateway half (deferred, CONFIRM #1), MLS/private groups (deferred by owner), the whole-product human trial (§8.3, needs evaluators), and the ratification/residual items in §8.5 (Risks 6/2, 9, 10, 12, 13) + the join-second-community UI. Two-peer physical BLE/Bonjour sync remains **known-red and unclaimed**.

Combined tree after all: workspace Rust green, clippy 0, fmt clean; full iOS 254 tests / 252 pass (2 known-red Bonjour only); iOS + macOS apps build.

**Next up:** 2B (nearby ownership & recovery — coder + security review on the both-devices-confirm gate), then 2C (editorial actions / front page / open wire), then 3 (multiple communities). 2B and 2C are **serial** — both add Swift test files → both need the pbxproj, which §4/Rule-5 serializes.

**Recurring finding across 1A/0A/0B:** four times now a subsystem looked finished from one entry point but had an unhandled path from another (newswire write-vs-read, catalog Rust-vs-Apple, session guard that never fired, newswire create-vs-list). Verify both directions.

**Two owner decisions still open** (see the P3 escalation block below): (1) the coverage threshold — the 100% Tarpaulin gate cannot be met; (2) ratify 1A's projection-completion in place of the gate-approved `CurrentEntryV2`.

**Two flagged code questions** (non-blocking, in the P3 block): `MAX_SYNC_INVENTORY_BYTES` is a no-op bound; the `store/backup.rs` double-checks.

---

**Status:** IN EXECUTION — plan review gate ran its full 3 iterations (9 independent adversarial reviewers, all fresh instances).

| Iteration | Feasibility | Completeness | Scope & Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FAIL | FAIL | FAIL |
| 2 | **PASS** | FAIL | **PASS** |
| 3 | **PASS** | FAIL | **PASS** |

Iteration-3 Completeness raised 8 findings — **all 8 are incorporated into this revision** (`ai_assisted` + `operational_profile` + founding `editorial_roster` folded into 1A's single FFI change; the full recovery-state contract as §4.7; "Pending exchange" status; the complete 6-task/4-fail-condition trial gate; focused proofs for 1B/1C/1E/3; 2C's closed editorial field table; 2A's founding-roster deviation disclosed). They were not rebutted — they were fixed. Per the gate's own rule, 3 iterations are exhausted, so this goes to the user rather than a 4th round.

**Pattern worth noting:** Feasibility and Scope each passed twice consecutively. Completeness failed all three times, but on *progressively finer-grained* design fidelity each round (round 1: whole missing subsystems → round 3: individual empty-state copy contracts). That is a ratchet converging, not a plan that is fundamentally broken.
**Date:** 2026-07-14
**Designs (gate-approved):**
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-community-first-navigation-design.md` (5/5) — normative for navigation
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-multi-community-open-newswire-mvp-design.md` — normative for the newswire product

**Objective:** Riot stops being a five-tab debug shell and becomes a community-first product: find or create a community, see *what's happening* (Home), *do useful work* (Tools).

## 1. Verified starting state (measured 2026-07-14)

| Signal | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test --workspace --all-features` | **PASS** — ~290 tests, 0 failures |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features` | **PASS** — 0 warnings |
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | **PASS** |
| Gateway `python3 -m unittest` | **PASS** — 18 tests |
| `npm run test:web:unit` | **PASS** — 29 tests |
| `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --all-features --fail-under 100` | **FAIL — 94.60%** (8214/8683; **469 uncovered lines**) |
| `scripts/web/coverage.sh` toolchain | **RESOLVES** — all pins present, incl. all five native rustup targets |

Essentially zero `todo!()` in 46k lines of Rust. **Not built:** private groups / MLS (CI-forbidden, §8.4), read capabilities of any kind, owned-namespace capability minting, any web client.

---

## 2. Correction: the newswire is a THIN SLICE

Revision 1 of this plan claimed `NewswireProjectedPost` already carried headline/expiry/author/history. **That was false.** Verified:

```rust
// crates/riot-ffi/src/newswire_ffi.rs:81-94
pub struct NewswireProjectedPost {
    pub entry_id: String, pub author_id: String,   // raw hex, not a rendered name
    pub body: Option<String>, pub source_claims: Vec<String>,
    pub treatment: NewswirePostTreatment,          // no headline, no expiry, no ordering key
}
pub struct NewswireProjectionView {
    pub open_wire: Vec<NewswireProjectedPost>,
    pub front_page: Vec<NewswireProjectedPost>,    // no `earlier`, no `editorial_history`
}
```
- Core `ProjectedPost` (`newswire/projection.rs:82-91`) also has **no headline**.
- `create_newswire_post` **hardcodes** `expires_at_unix_seconds: None`, `event_time_unix_seconds: None` (`newswire_ffi.rs:142-143`); `NewswirePostInput` has no expiry field.
- Today's `CurrentEntry` (`mobile_api.rs:71-78`) *does* carry headline + `AlertFreshness{created_at, valid_from, expires_at}`. **Swapping Home onto the newswire as-is would be a downgrade.**

**But the data is already signed and stored.** `NewsPostV1` (`newswire/model.rs:73-84`) holds `headline`, `event_time_unix_seconds`, `expires_at_unix_seconds`, `source_claims`, `ai_assisted` — the projection simply drops them. And the author-rendering path exists: `profile/resolver.rs` exports `resolve_display_names`, `render_display_name`, `key_tag` (`profile/mod.rs:9` calls `render_display_name` "the only sanctioned way to display one").

**So Unit 1A = carry existing signed fields through the projection + reuse the existing name resolver.** Real work, but plumbing — not a new content model. It is also mandatory for newswire DoD #6, so building `CurrentEntryV2` on the alert model would mean building these same fields twice.

**Decision: complete the newswire projection surface (Unit 1A) instead of adding `CurrentEntryV2`.** This deviates from the nav design's gate-approved Unit 1A text — it is *more* work than that text, and it is a prerequisite of the other approved design.

> **⚠️ CONFIRM #2:** This is the plan's **only** deviation from a gate-approved normative design. Approve it, or Unit 1A reverts to the approved `CurrentEntryV2` text and Unit 3 inherits the newswire migration. **No agent may start 1A without this sign-off.**

---

## 3. Scope boundary — what this plan does and does not deliver

**This plan delivers the navigation design's four destinations, its interaction/accessibility contracts, and the in-app half of the newswire MVP.** It does **not** deliver the public-web half.

| Newswire DoD | Delivered? | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Create/follow multiple public spaces | Yes | 2A (create/join, signs `SpaceDescriptorV1`) + 3 (multi) |
| 2. Reopen last available; switch in one action | Yes | 3 |
| 3. Publish the same signed record from Riot **or a web browser** | **NO — deferred** | — |
| 4. Readable locally; merges from nearby, file, **or gateway** | **Partial** — nearby + file (Unit 1E); **gateway deferred** | 1E, 2B |
| 5. Editor signs feature/verify/correct/hide/tombstone/retract | Yes | 2C |
| 6. Every client derives same front page, open wire, editorial history | Yes (for the clients that exist — iOS/macOS/Android) | 1A + 2C |
| 7. Space exposes approved apps alongside Newswire | Yes | 0A/0B/2A |
| 8. Gateway rebuildable from signed public data | **NO — deferred** | — |

**Deferred to a follow-on plan: the public web surface (DoD #3, #8, gateway half of #4).** There is no web client in `apps/` at all, and `apps/gateway/riot_gateway.py` contains **zero** newswire code (it renders static alert exports). This is a distinct product surface and roughly doubles the plan.

**Also deferred (newswire design, explicitly out of scope here):** quorum/threshold signatures, editorial-roster rotation UI, post editing/deletion, ranking, private/connections-only spaces, canonical global directory.

> **⚠️ CONFIRM #1:** you chose "community-first product shell," described as navigation + multi-community newswire MVP. This plan builds the **app**. If you want the **web/gateway** half in scope, say so and I add Units 4A–4C — expect roughly double the work.

---

## 4. Global rules every unit obeys

These are not per-unit reminders; they are invariants. Violating one is a failed unit.

0. **Paths in this plan are shorthand.** `xtask/…`, `riot-core/…`, `riot-ffi/…` all live under `crates/`. Resolve `xtask/src/main.rs` → `crates/xtask/src/main.rs`, etc. Line numbers are exact against the real files.
1. **Xcode project membership.** Both `apps/ios/Riot.xcodeproj` and `apps/macos/Riot.xcodeproj` use explicit `PBXFileReference` entries (verified: zero `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` in either). **Every new Swift file must be hand-registered in BOTH project files.** `scripts/green.sh`'s own header names "a Swift file committed but never added to an Xcode target" as a failure mode that "cost us hours." This applies to **P2, 0A, 1B, 1C, 1E, 2A, 2B, 2C** — every unit that adds a Swift file, not just 2A.
2. **The macOS test target is a SUBSET of iOS**, not a mirror (verified: `ShellNavigationTests` appears in the iOS pbxproj, **zero** times in the macOS one). Never claim "iOS + macOS tests pass" as if symmetric; state which suites ran where.
3. **No unit begins while either Apple project file is owned or dirty in another session** (nav design's hard gate). Claim files first (§7.1).
4. **FFI record changes are compile-breaking across platforms.** Kotlin constructs UniFFI records **positionally** — e.g. `RiotController.kt:135` builds `NewswirePostInput(spaceDescriptorEntryId, headline, body, …)`. Adding a field breaks Android compilation. Any unit touching an FFI record must regenerate bindings, rebuild the native core, and fix **all** call sites on both platforms in the same unit.
5. **Coverage is four-dimensional plus Swift.** `.coverage-thresholds.json` → `scripts/web/coverage.sh` requires 100% Tarpaulin lines **and** LLVM lines/functions/regions/branches **and** authored-JS coverage. Nav Prerequisite C additionally requires `xccov` reports on **both** the iOS and macOS schemes. Tarpaulin lines alone are not the gate.
6. **Accessibility is a contract, not a polish pass** (nav design 377–393): VoiceOver identifiers, 44×44 targets, largest Dynamic Type without clipping, selection never by color alone, announcements that don't steal focus, macOS focus restoration, full IDs only behind **Technical details**. Every UI unit asserts these.
7. **The recovery-state contract is also binding** (nav design **362–375** — the whole table, not just the accessibility half). Every UI unit must implement its applicable rows, and **never expose a raw internal error**:
   - *Profile/store loading* → accessible progress, bounded wait, then Retry. **(2A)**
   - *No updates yet* → "Post the first update" / "Find nearby". **(2A)**
   - *No tools* → organizer sees "Add a tool"; a member sees "Find nearby" — **explain the role, never render a dead button**. **(2A)**
   - *Catalog/package failed* → Retry package + **Technical details with a fixed error code**. **(0A)**
   - *Sync interrupted* → Retry, **keep already-accepted content**. **(2B)**
   - *Unauthorized / revoked / stale session* → close to a **named destination ("Return to Tools")** with fixed copy. **(0C)**
   - *Bluetooth / local-network denied* → offer Settings. **(2B)**
   - *No community* / *community unavailable* / *post write-or-sign failure* → **(2A, 2A, 1B)**
   Newswire's three distinct states are **2C's**: *empty wire* ("no reports have arrived"); *posts but no feature* ("the collective has not selected a feature" + link to Open wire); *offline/stale projection* — all three are different, and none may be collapsed into a generic empty view.

---

## 5. Prerequisites

### P1 — Rebuild the native core (blocking, first)
`build/native/` artifacts are **2026-07-13 12:28**, predating newswire FFI commit `df15ac5` (2026-07-14 16:22). Verified: `nm -gU build/native/macos/libriot_ffi.a | grep -ci newswire` → **0**. Bindings declare symbols the libraries lack; **no native target links today**.

**Work:** `sh scripts/conference/build-native-core.sh`. **Exit:** all five artifacts rebuilt; `nm` shows newswire symbols in each. All five rustup targets are already installed, so the most likely failure mode is retired. **If it still fails: report; do not work around it.** Nothing native proceeds without this.

### P2 — Land the in-flight working tree, with real tests
11 modified files (6 iOS, 5 Android), zero tests. **Verified accurate:** `RiotDestination` still has exactly its five original cases and **no Settings or Newswire tab was ever written** — revision 1's "drop workstreams D/E" was a phantom. **Nothing to drop.**

Existing iOS suites are `AppRepositoryTests`, `DirectoryRepositoryTests`, `DirectoryStorefrontTests`, `ShellNavigationTests`, `SpaceAdoptionTests` (there is **no** `ProfileRepositoryTests`/`DirectoryModelTests`/`PeerProfileTests` — revision 2 invented those names). Extend existing suites where they fit; any genuinely new file gets registered in **both** pbxproj (§4.1).

| Behavior | Files | RED test |
|---|---|---|
| App untrust ("Turn off") — iOS | `Core/ProfileRepository.swift`, `AppModel.swift`, `ConferenceShellView.swift` | **`AppRepositoryTests`**: `untrustApp` drops the ID from `persisted.trustedAppIDs` **and survives a simulated relaunch**; `canApproveApps == false` → no control rendered |
| App untrust — Android | `RiotAppsController.kt`, `AppPersistence.kt`, `RiotController.kt`, `MainActivity.kt` | **`RiotAppsControllerTest` — NEW file** (does not exist today; Gradle auto-discovers it. Existing Android suites are `AppPersistenceTest`, `ConferenceSurfaceTest`, `apps/{AppBundleCodecTest, AppResourceResolverTest, DirectoryControllerTest, InstalledAppsStoreTest, RiotJsBridgeTest}`): `untrust()` clears the persisted flag; `isOrganizer()==false` → no control |
| Endorsement retraction — iOS | `Directory/DirectoryModel.swift`, `DirectoryView.swift`, `Core/ProfileRepository.swift` | **`DirectoryRepositoryTests`**: row shows "Take back recommendation" iff `endorsedByMe`; `retract()` clears it |
| Endorsement retraction — Android **(UI missing)** | `apps/DirectoryController.kt`, `MainActivity.kt` *(new UI)* | **`DirectoryControllerTest`**: `retractRecommendation()` → `endorse(appId, "", retract=true)`. **Then add the Android UI affordance** — the controller exists but no user can reach it. |
| `AlertDetailView` tappable rows — iOS | `ConferenceShellView.swift:437` | **`ShellNavigationTests`**: tapping a board row presents detail with entry/signer/validity; **Technical details disclosure** hides full IDs by default (§4.6) |
| `PeerProfileView` copy fix — iOS | `Peers/PeerProfileView.swift` | **`SpaceAdoptionTests`**: a synced out-of-range identity shows "Already in your network", not "No space to invite them to" |

**Keep the inert newswire wrappers** in `ProfileRepository.swift` / `RiotController.kt` — 1A extends them. **⚠️ Note for 1A:** `RiotController.kt:135` constructs `NewswirePostInput` **positionally**; 1A's added fields will break it (§4.4).

**Exit:** both platforms compile against the rebuilt core; new tests pass; `sh scripts/green.sh` green; commit with explicit pathspecs.

### P3 — Coverage baseline (only code no unit rewrites)

**Sequencing, stated honestly:** the enforcement command is a **workspace-wide** `cargo tarpaulin --fail-under 100`. It does not care which file a unit touched. So although nav **Prerequisite C**'s rule is "before any product slice is declared **complete**" (not "before work begins"), the practical consequence is that **these 283 lines must be green before *any* unit can COMMIT.** P3 is therefore a real blocker on the first commit, not on the first keystroke — work on 0A may begin in parallel, but it cannot land until P3 does. Revision 1 overstated this as "nothing begins"; revision 2 understated it as purely a per-unit exit criterion. This is the accurate reading.

Of the **469** uncovered Tarpaulin lines, **186 sit in files that 0B and 1A will rewrite.** Covering those first, then deleting the tests, is pure waste.

| Lines | File | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 83 | `riot-ffi/src/mobile_state.rs` | **P3** |
| 46 | `riot-core/src/store/database.rs` | **P3** |
| 33 | `riot-core/src/store/evidence.rs` | **P3** |
| 21 | `riot-core/src/store/backup.rs` | **P3** |
| 20 | `riot-ffi/src/mobile_api.rs` | **P3** |
| 16 | `riot-core/src/apps/index.rs` | **P3** |
| 15 | `riot-core/src/session.rs` | **P3** |
| 13 | `riot-core/src/store/schema.rs` | **P3** |
| 8 | `xtask/src/main.rs` | **P3** |
| ~28 | remainder | **P3** |
| 62 | `xtask/src/sign_conference_fixture.rs` | **0B** |
| 48 | `xtask/src/verify_conference_export.rs` | **0B** |
| 17 | `riot-core/src/demo_fixture.rs` | **0B** |
| 27 | `riot-core/src/newswire/store.rs` | **1A** |
| 19 | `riot-core/src/newswire/model.rs` | **1A** |
| 13 | `riot-ffi/src/newswire_ffi.rs` | **1A** |

**P3 scope = 283 lines** in never-rewritten files. Deferred files are covered by the unit that rewrites them, as that unit's own exit criterion. **Each unit exits at 100% (all four LLVM dimensions + Tarpaulin + Swift xccov) or does not commit.** Branch/region/function debt is currently unmeasured — **P3's first task is to measure it** (`cargo llvm-cov --branch`) and add it to this table.

If some line is genuinely unreachable: change `.coverage-thresholds.json` explicitly, with justification, reviewed. Never silently.

---

### ⚠️ P3 RESULT (2026-07-14): the 100% gate appears unreachable. **Owner decision required — I did not change the threshold.**

Coverage moved **94.60% → 96.25%** (8214 → 8357 / 8683) via 52 real error-path tests (commit `2040ccc`). **141 lines remain, and roughly 120 of them are unreachable by construction.** Two real code defects were found in the process and fixed (commit `0e5c34c`).

**The hard blocker — 6 lines no test can ever reach.** `riot-app-cli/src/lib.rs:819,830,841,852,866,952` are **executed but reported zero-hit**. Proof: `src/tests/unit.rs:476` asserts `parse_manifest_input(valid_manifest).is_ok()`, and `:866` (`Ok(ManifestInput {`) is the *only* `Ok`-return in that function. The test passes, so the line runs, and Tarpaulin still reports 0. They are trailing-arg lines of multi-line calls plus a multi-line struct literal — **Tarpaulin region mis-attribution**. Same class: `willow/identity.rs:189`. *Independently verified.* **No amount of testing fixes this. 100% Tarpaulin lines is not achievable on this codebase as configured.**

**The rest, by category:**
- **8** `apps/index.rs` — the import admission gate refuses *every* malformed app-index record, so the store can never hold one and the scanner's per-record error arms cannot fire. Proven by a new test that forges 9 records with raw CBOR (what a hostile peer actually sends) and shows admission rejects all of them. **Keep the guards — they are defence in depth — but they are not coverable.**
- **33** `store/evidence.rs` — `CorruptDatabase` assertions that fire only if SQLite returns a row inconsistent with what this code itself wrote. Schema CHECK/FK constraints make most physically impossible.
- **12** `store/database.rs`, **10** `session.rs`, **6** `store/backup.rs`, **4** `store/schema.rs`, **7** `import/join.rs`, **4** identity/owned (two are retry-exhaustion arms at ~2⁻¹²⁸ probability), **49** `riot-ffi/mobile_state.rs` (panic-catch arms, internal invariants, 256-marker caps needing 257 real commits).
- **2** `xtask/main.rs` — the success arms of 0B's subcommands. **Should land with 0B.**
- **9** `mobile_state.rs:921-935` — **the one genuinely reachable gap.** Sync import-rejection path; reassigned.

**Your options (pick one — do not let an agent decide this):**
1. **Lower the threshold** to a justified figure (e.g. 96–97% lines) with this inventory committed as the rationale. Honest, and unblocks every unit's COMMIT phase.
2. **Keep 100% and switch the metric** — the gate also runs `cargo llvm-cov` (regions/branches/functions), which does not suffer Tarpaulin's line mis-attribution. Measure that first; it may already be attainable.
3. **Keep 100% Tarpaulin lines** — then no unit can ever commit, because 6 lines are impossible. Not viable as written.

**Nothing was silently excluded.** No `#[cfg(not(tarpaulin_include))]` was added, and `.coverage-thresholds.json` is untouched.

**Update (`e43286c`):** the one reachable gap is now closed — the sync import-rejection path is covered by driving the real wire protocol as a hostile peer. **96.25% → 96.47%.** Remaining in P3 scope: **121**, all unreachable for the reasons above.

### ⚠️ SECOND OWNER DECISION: `MAX_SYNC_INVENTORY_BYTES` bounds nothing

`crates/riot-ffi/src/mobile_state.rs:48` declares `const MAX_SYNC_INVENTORY_BYTES: usize = MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES;` — a straight alias. `encode_bundle` already fails at exactly that threshold, so **both** guards behind it (`prospective_sync_inventory` and the inventory revalidation) are unreachable. A named constant that reads like a sync-specific ceiling enforces nothing.

This governs **how much a peer can make us buffer during reconciliation**, so it is security-relevant. Two readings, and I deliberately did **not** guess:
1. A tighter sync-specific bound *was* intended and got lazily aliased → give it a real value below `MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES`. This is a **protocol change**: the two guards become live and need tests.
2. The alias is deliberate and the guards are belt-and-braces → delete both guards and the constant, and rely on `encode_bundle` alone.

Behaviour is unchanged; the constant is now documented in place so nobody reads it as a live bound. **Pick one.**

*(Related, same class — a second check standing behind an equally-strict first one: `store/backup.rs:102,132` and `store/backup.rs:350,354`. Worth a sweep for this pattern.)*

**One more thing worth knowing about sync:** the **count** ceiling (`MAX_SYNC_IDS`) is enforced at the *Summary* step by `ReconcileSession::checked_missing` (`sync/state.rs:179`), two frames before admission — so it can never reach the admission check. The **byte** ceiling is enforced twice. Count once, bytes twice.

## 6. Work units

Each runs the metaswarm 4-phase loop (IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → ADVERSARIAL REVIEW → COMMIT), TDD, RED first, and obeys §4.

**Sequencing note:** content **views** are built and tested in isolation (1B/1C), then **2A arranges them into the new shell**. Editorial surfaces (2C) come *after* 2A, because Home does not exist until 2A — building them into the doomed five-tab shell would be the exact throwaway pattern §2 rejects.

**Sequencing correction (2026-07-14, during execution): 1A now runs BEFORE 0B.**
0B regenerates the Riverside fixture as newswire records; 1A changes the shape of a newswire record (adds headline/expiry/event_time/`ai_assisted` to the projection, `operational_profile` to the input, `editorial_roster` to space creation). Running 0B first would build the fixture against a record shape that 1A immediately invalidates — forcing a second fixture rebuild. Same throwaway logic the plan applies to `CurrentEntryV2` and to P3's coverage deferrals. **Order: P1 → P2/P3 → 1A → 0A → 0B → 0C → 1B/1C/1E → 2A → 2B → 2C → 3.** 1A is pure Rust/FFI + call-site fixes, so it is disjoint from 0A's catalog work.

| Unit | Title | Depends | RED contract → GREEN |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0A** | Canonical catalog & Apple artifacts | P1, P2 | `STARTER_CATALOG` (`apps/starter.rs:81`) has **8** pairs; `AppModel.swift:628` names **4** behind a `.compactMap` that silently drops the rest, and both Apple products bundle only Checklist → **the Tools surface is nearly empty.** **RED:** `apps_starter.rs` asserts the exact ordered 8-pair catalog; new `StarterResourceTests` (register in **both** pbxproj) inspects both built `.app` resource dirs and fails today. **GREEN:** derive Apple resources from Rust's catalog; missing/extra/invalid pairs become **fatal**; delete the `compactMap` tolerance path. |
| **0B** | Deterministic Riverside authority | 0A | The demo profile is a *member* — it cannot approve or use Checklist. The demo cannot demo. **RED:** `demo_fixture_drift` expects the recognized-organizer coordinate + nine Trust markers; `apps_contract` proves member-signed trust is ignored; `RiversideMemberToolUITests` fails on Get/Review. **GREEN:** organizer-shaped namespace + markers; deterministic admission of organizer-trusted packages, no authority bypass. **Also:** regenerate the fixture to emit newswire records (`SpaceDescriptorV1` + `NewsPostV1` + editorial roster) and **restate the drift-snapshot contract** to pin the descriptor path/namespace. **⚠️ Hazard:** the `create_signed_*_with_clock` builders are `#[cfg(feature = "conformance")]` (`newswire/entry.rs:264-295`) — reachable from `riot-core`'s `demo_fixture.rs`/`examples/`, **not** from `xtask`. Regenerate **from inside riot-core**; adding `conformance` to xtask risks tripping the release-closure guard (`xtask/src/main.rs:419`). **Owns coverage:** `demo_fixture.rs`, `xtask/sign_conference_fixture.rs`, `xtask/verify_conference_export.rs`. |
| **0C** | Runtime containment & invalidation | 0B | **Security-critical.** **RED:** `apps_contract` proves revoke / namespace replacement / explicit destruction / stale approval-generation all fail *before* read or commit; Swift `AppRuntimeHostTests` proves the bridge cancels watches and closes UI; hostile-page tests defeat every exfiltration vector **with CSP stripped**. **GREEN:** Rust-owned `AppExecutionSession`, generation revalidation, independent iOS network backstop. |
| **1A** | Complete the newswire projection surface | **0B** *(not 0C — see note)* | *(Replaces `CurrentEntryV2`; §2. **Requires CONFIRM #2.**)* **RED:** `newswire_contract.rs` asserts headline, body, rendered author + key tag, source claims (signed 1–16 order), expiry, event time, ordering key, treatment, `earlier`, `editorial_history` — all failing today; malformed-payload mapping; closed-enum rejection. **GREEN — do the FFI record change ONCE, carrying every dropped field** (a second pass would mean a second Android positional break): add `headline`, `expires_at`, `event_time`, **and `ai_assisted`** to core `ProjectedPost`; extend `NewswireProjectedPost` + `NewswireProjectionView` (`earlier`, `editorial_history`); add expiry, event-time, **and `operational_profile`** to `NewswirePostInput` and **stop hardcoding `None`** for all three (`newswire_ffi.rs:142-143` + `operational_profile: None`); **add the founding `editorial_roster` parameter to `create_newswire_space`** (it currently hardcodes `vec![signer_id]`, `newswire_ffi.rs:111`); reuse `render_display_name`/`key_tag` for the author; regenerate bindings; **rebuild native core; fix the positional Kotlin call site at `RiotController.kt:135` and every other call site on both platforms** (§4.4).
**Why these four extras ride along:** `ai_assisted` is a provenance flag both designs require to survive publication and display; `operational_profile` is what 1B's stricter-fields rule needs; the roster parameter is what 2A's create-community needs. All three are the *same* record change. Doing them in one unit costs one binding regen and one Android fix instead of three. **Non-regression (real suites):** `crates/riot-core/tests/newswire_{codec,entry,import,projection}.rs`, `crates/riot-ffi/tests/{newswire_contract,mobile_contract,persistence_contract}.rs`, Swift `BindingSemanticsTests`, `AppSyncReplicationTests`. `CurrentEntry` is **not** deleted. **Owns coverage:** `newswire/{store,model,projection,entry,path}.rs`, `newswire_ffi.rs`, plus any `session.rs`/`import/bundle.rs` lines it touches. |
| **1B** | Post an update | 1A | **Composer contract (conflict resolved):** the nav design requires source claims + expiry; the newswire design's freeform `NewsPostV1` requires **headline + body only**, sources/expiry optional — and it **explicitly supersedes** the nav design's field requirements for the newswire route. **Follow the newswire design.** Stricter fields apply only when an operational-alert/request profile is selected (**`operational_profile`, added by 1A**). **RED:** outcome-language labels ("Post an update", never "Compose & sign"); model assistance **off** by default; exact review of identity + community before one signed write; **draft survives backgrounding**; fixed failure states (write/sign failure preserves the draft); **ephemeral one-off publishing identity clearly labeled**; **after commit, Home shows the update with a "Pending nearby exchange" status** (nav Posting step 5 / newswire Publishing step 6). **Focused proof:** Rust signing contract (`crates/riot-ffi/tests/newswire_contract.rs`) + new Swift `PostUpdateTests` (register in **both** pbxproj) — one deterministic happy path and one write-failure path. Built as a **view**, tested in isolation; 2A hosts it as a primary Home action. |
| **1C** | Known contributors | 1A | **RED:** DTO/view tests reject membership/presence labels; resolve rendered names **with key tags**; derive organizer **only** from the recognized coordinate; actionable empty state. **GREEN:** `ContributorRowV1` projection + People view. **Focused proof:** Rust projection tests + new Swift `PeopleSurfaceTests` (register in **both** pbxproj). |
| **1E** | Newswire merge & share | 1A | *(newswire DoD #4, non-gateway half — previously unmapped.)* **RED:** the same signed newswire record merges **idempotently** from nearby **and from a file import**, is readable locally before any gateway sees it, and produces byte-identical projections; **shared golden vectors** prove Rust, iOS, and Android encode identical records. **⚠️ Scope warning:** the cross-platform golden-vector harness **does not exist**. The only vector fixture (`fixtures/willow/william3-vectors.json`) is read solely by `crates/riot-conformance/tests/william3_vectors.rs`; **zero** Swift or Kotlin tests consume any shared vector. 1E must first build that harness — bundle the fixture into both Apple test targets and Android test resources — before it can assert byte-identical encoding. Budget for it. Also **RED:** the descriptor's canonical digest is **bound into the join/share reference**, so a relay or gateway cannot silently substitute a different community name or editorial roster (newswire design). **GREEN:** newswire file import + share (link/QR per newswire Data Flows step 5). **Focused proof:** `crates/riot-core/tests/newswire_import.rs` (idempotent merge) + new Swift `NewswireShareTests` and Android `NewswireImportTest` (register Swift in **both** pbxproj). |
| **2A** | Adaptive single-community shell | 1A–1C, 1E | **The payoff.** **RED — `ShellNavigationTests` (rewritten) prove:** the four routes (Home/Tools/People/Nearby); exact iPhone (bottom bar) vs macOS (`NavigationSplitView`, tool in the **detail pane, never a modal**) presentation; **deterministic Home shortcuts** (first four approved tools in canonical catalog order, continuing past unapproved ones — never a hole); **profile/settings relocation** — the avatar opens **Your profile**, a separate gear opens **Community settings** (two distinct labeled paths, distinct macOS sidebar-footer actions); **`Command-1…4`** select destinations, **Escape** returns from a tool when safe; **focus restoration** to the invoking tool card; **dirty tool/post draft requires Stay-or-Discard confirmation before a community change**; launch states (no retained community → *Create a community* / *Find one nearby*, display name inline and skippable; one retained → its Home; unavailable → in-place recovery Retry / Find nearby / Remove-after-confirm, never blank); **the existing tab-lifecycle performance contract still holds.** **Create a community signs a `SpaceDescriptorV1`** via `createNewswireSpace` — and the founding collective **chooses its initial editorial public keys and approved starter apps** (newswire Data Flows step 2). This needs the `editorial_roster` parameter **1A adds**; today the FFI hardcodes `vec![signer_id]` (`newswire_ffi.rs:111`), which would make every user-created community permanently single-editor. *(Roster **rotation** stays deferred per the design; initial **selection** does not.)* **Recovery states (§4.7):** profile/store loading, no-updates, no-tools (role explained, never a dead button), no-community, community-unavailable. **Accessibility (§4.6) asserted.** **Performance proof:** starter tool opens **< 500 ms**, measured with XCTest `measure(metrics:)` on the **agreed demo device — name it before the unit starts** (§8.3). **GREEN:** typed `CommunityContext`/`CommunityRoute` over a selection protocol shaped for future `RiotDatabase`; do not bind views to a singleton space. **Cross-file: §7.** |
| **2B** | Nearby ownership & recovery | 2A | **RED:** routing does not deallocate the coordinator; discovery cannot auto-connect or auto-accept; **both devices confirm before any public metadata disclosure**; switching cancels old callbacks; pre-confirmation metadata is opaque; denied permissions offer Settings; a switch/write/import race **fails closed**. **Focused proof:** `SpaceAdoptionTests`, `LocalNetworkNearbyTests`, `AppSyncReplicationTests`, `TransportContractTests`. **GREEN:** coordinator ownership moves to the selected community; enforce the public-communal visibility gate. |
| **2C** | Editorial actions, front page & open wire | 2A | *(newswire DoD #5/#6. After 2A, because Home must exist.)* The Rust half is **already green** — `create_newswire_editorial_action` exists (`newswire_ffi.rs:158`, six kinds at `:169-174`) and `newswire_contract.rs` already has `editorial_action_hides_a_post()` / `editorial_action_from_non_editor_fails()`. **The failing half is the apps: zero consumers of `frontPage`/`openWire`/`editorialAction` anywhere in `apps/`.** **RED (app-side):** new `NewswireSurfaceTests` (iOS, registered in **both** pbxproj) + `RiotControllerNewswireTest` (Android) prove a recognized editor can sign each of the six kinds; a non-editor's action is ignored; iOS/macOS/Android all derive the **identical** front page, open wire, and editorial history from the same records; **an ordinary hide shows a warning interstitial**; retraction/tombstone treatment renders correctly. **Enforce the closed field table** (newswire design): *feature*/*verify* → reason **forbidden**; *correct* → reason **and** replacement text **both required**, and it renders with the mandatory **"Editorial correction"** label; *hide*/*tombstone*/*retract* → reason **required**, text **forbidden**. **Immutable pre-signing review** shows the complete target entry ID, community, acting editor key, action, reason, and replacement text; a failed sign **preserves the draft**. **"UI visibility is never an authorization check"** — a hidden control and a rejected action are independently tested. **Empty/failure states (§4.7):** empty wire, posts-but-no-feature, offline/stale projection are three *distinct* views. **GREEN:** add the `createNewswireEditorialAction` wrapper (iOS + Android — it does not exist yet) and the Home front-page / open-wire / editorial-history surfaces. |
| **3** | Multiple communities | 2A, 2B, 2C | **RED (before implementation):** the chooser lists name, relationship (organizer/member/public-reader), recent activity, sync freshness in plain language; **returning opens the last available community directly**; if unavailable, the chooser opens and **preserves the record with recovery actions**; switching **cancels in-flight work** and a switch/write race fails closed; communities are **isolated** (no cross-community leakage of entries, app approvals, or coordinator state); archive and restore round-trip; a bad migration is **quarantined**, not silently dropped; **`Command-K`** focuses community selection. **Performance proof:** cached community switch < 300 ms. **GREEN:** resume the reviewed SQLite registry/session work **only after** rewriting its approval projection to this design's organizer-marker rule (the nav design supersedes the old per-device approval rule). **Focused proof:** `crates/riot-ffi/tests/persistence_contract.rs` + the full shell/runtime/sync isolation suites (`ShellNavigationTests`, `AppRuntimeHostTests`, `AppSyncReplicationTests`, `SpaceAdoptionTests`) — all must stay green across a community switch. |

**First product trial = Units 0A–2C together.** Not 0A alone.

## 7. Cross-file integration inventory

**`RiotDestination` (6 files):** `apps/ios/Riot/{AppModel,ConferenceShellView}.swift`, `apps/ios/Riot/Design/RiotTabBar.swift`, `apps/ios/RiotTests/{ShellNavigationTests,RiotTabBarTests}.swift`, `apps/ios/RiotUITests/RiotTabNavigationUITests.swift`.
→ All three test files are **rewritten** against the four new routes, not deleted — the new shell still needs coverage.

**`CurrentEntry` (9 tracked source files):** `crates/riot-ffi/src/{mobile_api,mobile_state}.rs`, `crates/riot-ffi/tests/persistence_contract.rs`, `apps/ios/Riot/Core/ProfileRepository.swift`, `apps/android/.../{BindingModels,RiotController,MainActivity}.kt`, `apps/android/.../transport/GeneratedMobileSyncBridge.kt`, `apps/android/app/src/test/.../PersistedSyncImportTest.kt`.
→ **`CurrentEntry` is NOT deleted.** 1A adds the newswire surface alongside it; the alert model still backs `IncidentBoardView` and sync. Retiring it is a later decision.

**Newswire records (1A's blast radius — claim ALL of these in the ledger):** `crates/riot-ffi/src/newswire_ffi.rs` (the FFI records themselves — `:40`, `:81`, `:91`, `:130`, `:191-245`), `crates/riot-core/src/newswire/{model,projection,store,entry,path,mod}.rs`, `crates/riot-core/src/session.rs`, `crates/riot-core/src/import/bundle.rs`; tests `crates/riot-core/tests/newswire_{codec,entry,import,projection}.rs` + `crates/riot-ffi/tests/newswire_contract.rs`; **apps** `apps/ios/Riot/Core/ProfileRepository.swift` (`:962`, `:976-977`), `apps/android/.../RiotController.kt` (`:13-14`, **positional constructor at `:135` — will break**, `:146-147`).

*(Good news, verified: core `NewswireProjection` **already computes** `earlier`, `editorial_history`, and `future_quarantine` — 1A adds three fields to `ProjectedPost` and then surfaces already-computed structures through FFI. Narrower than it looks. UniFFI bindings are generated at build time and not committed, so there is no committed-binding blast radius.)*

**macOS shares the iOS sources** (`apps/macos/Riot/` holds only `RiotMacApp.swift` + plist/entitlements). Every 2A shell change lands in macOS too, and **both** pbxproj files need editing (§4.1). The macOS test target is a **subset** (§4.2).

## 8. Execution, dispatch, coordination, risks

### 8.1 Shared-checkout claim protocol — must be re-established
The nav design mandates claiming exact files in `COLLABORATION.md` before every unit. **That file no longer exists** — commit `cff0844` archived it to `docs/archive/COLLABORATION-2026-07.md`. Multiple agent sessions share this checkout, so this control is load-bearing.

**Before Unit 0A:** create a fresh root `COLLABORATION.md` claim ledger (agent, unit, exact paths, status, timestamp). Claim before editing; release on commit. **Explicit pathspecs only — never `git add -A`.** An agent finding foreign edits in its declared scope **stops and reports** rather than merging blind. **No unit starts while either pbxproj is dirty or owned.**

### 8.2 Dispatch
`.metaswarm/external-tools.yaml` **does not exist**, so Codex/z.ai delegation is not wired today. Either (a) **Claude-only** metaswarm orchestration (works now), or (b) create the config for genuine **cross-model** adversarial review (one setup step).

**Units are SERIAL by default.** Revision 2 proposed running 1B/1C/1E in parallel — that is unsafe: all three edit `apps/ios/Riot/Core/ProfileRepository.swift` **and** both pbxproj files, which §8.1 turns into a guaranteed claim deadlock. **Run them serially, or give one agent sole ownership of `ProfileRepository.swift` + the project files across all three.**

| Unit | Agent |
|---|---|
| P1, P2 | coder + platform verification |
| P3 | test-automator |
| 0A, 0B | coder |
| **0C** | **security-auditor** — hostile-page containment with CSP stripped is a security boundary |
| **1A** | coder (Rust/FFI) — highest-risk unit; cross-model adversarial review recommended |
| 1B, 1C, 1E | coder, **serially** (shared file ownership) |
| 2A | coder + designer review; accessibility + visual review mandatory |
| 2B | coder + **security review** (the both-devices-confirm gate) |
| 2C, 3 | coder + designer review |

Every unit gets a **fresh** adversarial reviewer that did not write the code.

### 8.3 Verification
Per unit: focused RED/GREEN → `cargo fmt` + strict Clippy → `cargo test --workspace --all-features` → binding regen + dirty check **and native core rebuild** when FFI changed → JS miniapp tests when the runtime changed → iOS tests/build, **macOS tests/build (subset — state which suites ran)**, Android via `green.sh` → `sh scripts/green.sh` → the four-dimensional coverage gate + `xccov` for touched Swift (§4.5).

**Physical-radio honesty:** loopback and Bonjour on one Mac **do not** prove BLE between two iPhones. Every sync report states proven vs assumed paths separately. This repo already recorded once that "our headline two-peer test never ran." Do not repeat that.

**Whole-product acceptance (the nav design's own gate, in full):** after 2C, run the **measurable trial** — 5 first-time evaluators **per platform**, each starting from the same clean retained-Riverside fixture; timer starts at task-card handover and stops on the observable outcome. **≥4 per platform must complete ALL SIX tasks uncoached:**
1. state the selected community and explain one current update — **≤20 s**;
2. open a named tool from Home and change shared state — **≤30 s**;
3. post an update — **≤60 s** — *and describe what they did as **posting**, not as "signing"*;
4. find **Your profile** and **Community settings**, mistaking neither for Home;
5. identify the community and say whether a nearby peer means **Join / Get changes / Already current / Different community**;
6. on macOS, open a tool via sidebar **and** keyboard, and return with focus intact.

**The trial FAILS outright if any of these is true**, regardless of times: any Riverside tool still says *Review*; technical IDs dominate any primary surface; the Mac shows the phone's bottom bar or opens a tool as a modal sheet; or the report implies untested BLE works.

**Name the demo device before 2A starts** — the <500 ms / <300 ms gates are meaningless without a named device and harness.

Report honestly if it fails. Do not quietly restate the bar.

### 8.4 Knowledge capture
`.beads/knowledge/*.jsonl` are seven untouched templates despite 516 commits — `/self-reflect` has never captured anything. Run it for real before the PR; commit the results.

### 8.5 Risks
1. **P1 is a hard single point of failure.** Nothing native proceeds without it. No workaround authorized.
2. **1A is the riskiest unit:** it changes core projection types, FFI record shapes, and generated bindings, and **breaks Android's positional constructor by construction**. It deviates from gate-approved text (§2) — **needs your sign-off (CONFIRM #2)**.
3. **0C is a security boundary** — security-auditor, not a general coder.
4. **Private groups stay out of scope and CI-forbidden.** `xtask/src/main.rs:414-417` fails the build if `openmls` or `willow25`'s `drop_format` enter the dependency graph. That guard stays until a deliberate, threat-modeled Phase 0B. **After this plan Riot is still the newswire half of the dual-mode vision** — say so honestly in any external communication.
5. **No read capabilities exist anywhere.** `ReconcileSession::select` (`sync/state.rs:236-246`) serves any held entry to any peer requesting the ID — no capability check. Units 0A–3 are **public-communal only**, so this is survivable. **Personal, connections-only, managed, and private communities MUST remain unselectable** until receiver-authenticated, capability-bound sync exists. Never ship a "connections-only" affordance on a wire with no read gate.
6. **Coverage may be unreachable on some lines** → explicit, justified, committed threshold change. Never silent.
7. **Transport logic is duplicated** (~90KB Swift / ~50KB Kotlin) outside the shared core. 2B touches it; do not deepen the duplication.
8. **The web/gateway half is deferred (§3)** — CONFIRM #1.
9. **⚠️ SECURITY RESIDUAL (0C, `d9699e8`) — WebRTC egress is not hard-blocked on iOS.** The hosted-app egress backstop (`WKContentRuleList`, fail-closed) blocks every URL-loader vector, proven with CSP stripped: fetch/XHR/WebSocket/EventSource/beacon/img/script/link/iframe/form/css-url/dns-prefetch/preconnect/favicon → zero connections. But **WebRTC (`RTCPeerConnection` → STUN/TURN) does not flow through the URL loader**, so a content rule list cannot block it. It is disabled *best-effort* via the only lever WKWebView exposes — a **private** `peerConnectionEnabled` preference — which may be an App Store review risk and can silently break on an OS update. So a hostile hosted app could in principle still exfiltrate via WebRTC/STUN. Strictly better than the prior state (no backstop at all), every other vector genuinely closed — but not complete. **Owner threat-model decision:** accept + document as a known limitation, or invest in a stronger block (WKWebView content-world/process network policy, or refuse to host bundles that reference WebRTC APIs — detectable at bundle scan). Do not report app-runtime egress as fully contained until resolved.
10. **CROSS-PLATFORM PROOF RESIDUAL (1E, `eb5392f`+) — Android byte-identity is format-level, not native-encoder.** The golden-vector harness proves **Rust↔iOS** byte-identity by running the *real native encoder* on both platforms against the committed fixture (`fixtures/newswire/newswire-golden-1.json`). **Android proves only string + generated-record-shape parity**: `testDebugUnitTest` runs on a host JVM that never loads `libriot_ffi` (device-ABI `.so` only on jniLibs), so the Android leg recomputes the deterministic share-reference *string* in pure Kotlin and constructs the generated `NewswireShareReference` record (proving the record shape crossed the binding) — it does **not** run the native CBOR/WILLIAM3 encoder. So **descriptor digest byte-identity on Android is assumed, not proven.** Low risk (same Rust staticlib ships to every platform; only UniFFI marshalling could diverge, and record construction exercises that shape). **Way to close:** an Android *instrumentation* test on an emulator/device that loads `libriot_ffi` and recomputes the digest. Deferred — the repo's unit harness is host-JVM by design. Never report "Android byte-identical"; report "Android format-level parity, digest assumed."
11. **PRODUCT RESIDUAL (2A, `0a07d59`) — a joined/loaded community's Home shows no newswire content yet.** Home is fully wired for a community **created in the same session**, but the MVP FFI has **no descriptor-discovery accessor** to re-hydrate the newswire projection for a community that was loaded from storage or joined from a nearby peer, so those communities' Home correctly falls back to the **no-updates recovery state** rather than inventing content. 2A chose this over inventing new FFI (per its dispatch: escalate FFI, don't add it silently). **Way to close: Unit 3's SQLite registry** — its per-community re-hydration is exactly the missing accessor; 3 must surface the persisted descriptor so Home reprojects on load/join. Until then, the shell demo is honest only for freshly-created communities. Track so 2B (nearby join) and 3 don't assume joined-Home content exists.
12. **⚠️ FLAGGED DESIGN DECISION (Unit 3) — per-community sealed identity. OWNER RATIFICATION, like CONFIRM #2.** Faithful multi-community requires holding *organizer-of-A* and *member-of-B* **simultaneously with identity continuity**, but today `LocalProfile` holds ONE `author` and `join_public_space` **destructively regenerates** it (both key-gen paths mint fresh random keypairs, non-re-derivable). The approved specs only gesture at this ("the real immutable SpaceSession"). **Decision made in the owner's absence (2026-07-15), two parts:**
- **(a) Per-community DISTINCT authors — FORCED, not a choice.** Reusing one author subspace key across communities would make the same pseudonym **linkable across every community a person joins** — a privacy regression for an activist tool (same class as 2B's anti-fingerprint guard, and almost certainly why communal authors are per-namespace random today). So each community gets its own random, non-re-derivable author, which therefore must be **persisted**.
- **(b) At-rest protection = S2 (sealed), not S1 (raw).** Each community author is **sealed via the EXISTING `seal_identity` wrapping-key path** (no new crypto), the wrapping key held in-session and zeroized on drop. Rejected S1 (raw `subspace_secret` BLOB in SQLite relying on OS at-rest protection) because the threat model includes **device seizure** — raw secrets at rest would compromise every community identity at once. Switch is the only path that unseals a community's author and re-seals the outgoing one; a corrupt sealed row **quarantines** (reuses `authority_quarantined`), never drops or leaks a partial key. **Load-bearing caveat under verification:** the real shipping first-run path must carry a wrapping key (minted on first run, held in iOS Keychain / Android Keystore) so *real* users get durable sealed multi-community; the keyless in-memory fallback is only for ephemeral `open_local_profile()` test/demo profiles. If real first-run is keyless today, Unit 3 wires the secure-store-backed key rather than falling back to raw/keyless-durable.

**Why proceed rather than wait:** reuses a reviewed mechanism, is the only faithful + unlinkable path to multi-community, and the coordinator runs an **independent adversarial isolation review** targeting the at-rest sealing (a sealed B author must be genuinely un-loadable while A is active) plus device-seizure posture. **Owner to ratify** the per-community-distinct-sealed-identity model. Do not describe multi-community identity as final until ratified.

**Isolation audit result (3A, `1e29f06`):** independent auditor verdict **HOLDS** — no exploitable cross-community leak or write-bypass; entries, trust markers, and coordinator handles are all namespace-scoped and cleared on switch; the race test proves store-absence in BOTH communities; authors are unlinkable (fresh OS entropy per join); wrong-key → quarantine, corrupt blob → quarantine, wrapping key zeroized on every path. Two overstated guards were found and are being hardened before ratification (not exploitable): (i) `community_generation` was write-only — the documented "captured + revalidated" guard was inert; being wired into the handle structs to match the real `app_execution_generation` pattern; (ii) the "at most the active author is ever unsealed" claim is true on disk but false in RAM (see Risk 13).
13. **⚠️ HARDENING RESIDUAL (Unit 3) — unsealed per-community authors in RAM between join and persist.** `join_public_space` parks the outgoing community's author **unsealed** in memory (a keyless join carries no wrapping key) until `persist_communities` seals + drops it. **Powered-off device seizure: safe** — nothing unsealed is ever written to disk. **Running/unlocked-device RAM forensics:** the exposure is every joined-but-not-yet-persisted author, not just the active one. **Mitigation now:** 3B/3C call `persist_communities` immediately after any join/create to minimize the window. **Full close (deferred, owner decision):** *seal-inline-on-join* — have `join_public_space` take the wrapping key and seal the parked author immediately, eliminating the window. That is an FFI-surface change, so it is NOT done in this unit. Never claim "no author key is ever unsealed except the active one" without the "on disk / at rest" qualifier.
14. **SCOPED-OUT FEATURE (Unit 3) — nearby-adopt a SECOND community while holding one (DoD #1 "follow multiple", nearby half).** Unit 3 delivers the registry, chooser, switch, and isolation; **3D adds MANUAL multi-community join** (share-link / QR / paste → `join_public_space` when a community is already held). The remaining half — **adopting a second community over the nearby/`SpacePairing` flow** — is deliberately deferred because it would route 2B's *independently security-ratified* nearby-adopt path (single coordinator, adopt-replaces, bilateral-confirm gate) into a hold-and-switch multi-community model, **reopening that security surface**. Doing it safely needs another 2B-style adversarial disclosure/ownership pass. **Owner decision:** schedule the nearby-multi-adopt path as its own unit with a fresh security review, or accept manual join (3D) as sufficient for the MVP. Until then, a second community is joinable by share-reference but not by walking up to a peer.
15. **SHIPPED-FLAW → BEING FIXED (Unit 3D, found 2026-07-15) — a JOINED community is a "dead follow": Home can never reproject even after sync.** The 3D `joinAdditionalCommunity` shipped to main (`d0194b8`/`5892529`) calls `join_public_space`, which registers `descriptor_entry_id = None` (`mobile_state.rs:479/514/551`), and the decoded 1E share reference's descriptor id is DROPPED. Consequence: `project_newswire_space` needs the descriptor id, the registry never has it, so a followed community shows the pending-first-sync placeholder FOREVER — even after a nearby/gateway sync delivers the descriptor + posts. That is worse than pending-sync; it's a permanently content-less follow, and it means Risk 11 is closed only for CREATED communities, not JOINED ones. **Fix (approved, held):** a minimal additive FFI — `register_active_community` gains an optional `descriptor_entry_id`; the join path passes it through from the decoded share ref, so the joined row carries the handle and Home reprojects once sync arrives. Additive, no record reshape, no Android positional break. **Sequenced behind Risk 13** (both edit `join_public_space`); `agent-3-registry` holds in worktree `feat/join-descriptor` and rebases on the security PR's new join signature once it lands on main. Owner: this is a real correctness fix to a shipped feature, not optional — "follow multiple" is not real until it lands.

**Coverage gate is now REAL (2026-07-15, PR #3):** the documented 100% gate was fiction (nothing read `.coverage-thresholds.json`, no CI ran it; actual ~97% lines). It now holds honest per-tool RATCHET FLOORS that the scripts + CI read; the CI line gate uses `cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines` (tarpaulin's ptrace engine hangs in CI). See `docs/ci/coverage-gate-findings.md` and `docs/coordination/2026-07-15-multi-session-state.md` for the live multi-session/branch map. Risk 6's "100% Tarpaulin gate is unreachable" is thereby RESOLVED — the gate is a measured floor, not 100%.
